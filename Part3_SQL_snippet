--This snippet wants to create a table keeping track of the orders related to vendors that are part of a sales activity
SELECT * FROM `orders`
   WHERE brand = 'EF_GR'
   AND vendor_id IN (
       SELECT id FROM `bookings`)
   AND day_key >= (SELECT MIN(DATE(created_at))
       FROM `bookings`)

--First of all, I don't see the create table statement. I will assume that for the sake of this exercise, we're interested in the dataset, 
--not the DDL of the table, so let's move on
--I would write the above like this:
SELECT a.* FROM `orders` a inner join `bookings` b on (a.vendor_id = b.id and a.day_key >= created_at)
where a.brand = 'EF_GR'
--The reason is that I think it's an error to simply say
--   day_key >= (SELECT MIN(DATE(created_at)) FROM `bookings`)
--because that will consider all records from `booking`, not only the ones related to the given vendor_id.
--Apart from that, I always prefer joins over the IN () clause.
